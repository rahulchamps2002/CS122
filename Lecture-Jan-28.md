### What is Python?
* Python is an interpreted language

## Python basics:
* How to write code?
  * it is very simple and pretty much straight forward

#### Printing Example:
```python
print("Hello World") # returns Hello World
```

#### Commenting example:
```python
# this is a single line comment

'''
This is a multi-line comment
'''
```

* When coding, make sure that you comment a lot because it will help your understanding of what you are programming

### Variables and Types:
* variables do not need pre-definition like other programming languages do
* a variable x can be any data type until it is initialized with a specific value

#### Examples of Variable initialization:
```python
a = "Hello" # this is a string
b = 10      # this is an integer
c = 1.10    # this is a double/float
d = 'd'     # this is a char/string
```
